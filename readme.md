Buto.tv lightbox plugin
=======================

Buto.tv lightbox plugin created and tested with jquery 1.9.0
will create a image of the poster frame of a Buto video on the Buto.tv platform

When you click on the image then you get a lightbox with the video 
inside ready to play.

The JS will call the Buto API to get some data about the video such
as poster frame uri, video uri in our CDN.  It's all CORS safe so don't worry.

Usage
-----

basic usage:    

    <div class='buto-lightbox-here' data-id='12345' style='width:451px;height:254px'>Buto Poster frame goes in here</div>
    
    $('div.buto-lightbox-here').butoLightbox();             

Function will use basic dimensions that you've set of the container element

**NB** the *data-id* attribute of our DIV which must contain the unique Buto video_id otherwise the plugin won't know which video to load
